This was a project for my CS164 Intro to Computing class. It is a finite state machine, which can be used to interact with my virtal pet (or pest, depending on your point of view): 
the Phillie Phanatic. The user can interact with the Phanatic in six different ways. Depending on his current mood (or state), he will respond differently. Click the "Start" button 
for the standard output to begin interacting with my virtual pet. Also included is the documentation page, also part of the class assignment, which provides a more in-depth overview
of the project.
